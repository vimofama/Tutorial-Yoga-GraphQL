* Note: This object type is generated because "LinkMapper" is declared. This is to ensure runtime safety.
*
* When a mapper is used, it is possible to hit runtime errors in some scenarios:
* - given a field name, the schema type's field type does not match mapper's field type
* - or a schema type's field does not exist in the mapper's fields
*
* If you want to skip this file generation, remove the mapper or update the pattern in the `resolverGeneration.object` config.
