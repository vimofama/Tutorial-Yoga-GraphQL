Tutorial: [How to build a GrphQL serverâ†—](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server/tutorial/basic)

## Overview
---
GraphQL is the rising star of backend technologies. Itâ€™s a popular alternative for REST as an API design paradigm and is becoming the new standard for exposing the data and functionality of a web server.

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to build a GraphQL HTTP server entirely from scratch.

You are going to use the following technologies:

- [Node.jsâ†—](https://nodejs.org/)â€‰ - as an engine and runtime for our server

- [TypeScriptâ†—](https://typescriptlang.org/)â€‰ - a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript giving you better tooling at any scale

- graphql-yoga- the easiest way to build an HTTP GraphQL server

- [graphql-jsâ†—](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) - we will use the core graphql library as execution engine for our server

- [GraphiQLâ†—](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)â€‰: A graphical interface that allows you to interactively explore the functionality of a GraphQL API by sending query, mutation and subscription operations. Itâ€™s somewhat similar to [Postmanâ†—](https://getpostman.com/) which offers comparable functionality for REST APIs. Among other things, GraphiQL:
    * Auto-generates comprehensive documentation for all available API operations
    * Provides an editor where you can write queries, mutations & subscriptions with auto-complete and syntax highlighting

- [SQLiteâ†—](https://sqlite.org/)â€‰: A lightweight and easy-to-use relational database management system for persisting data on the file system

- [Prismaâ†—](https://prisma.io/)â€‰: The glue between your code and SQLite database. Use Prisma Client to access your database inside GraphQL resolvers

## Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vimofama/Tutorial-Yoga-GraphQL.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Use `pnpm` to install all necessary dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set Up the Database with Prisma
Generate the migrations for your database:
```bash
pnpm prisma migrate dev
```

If you make changes on `schema.prisma` file, you'll need to create a new migration:
```bash
pnpm prisma migrate dev --name name_of_migration
```
Then, generate new Prisma client:
```bash
pnpm prisma generate
```
---
## Running the Server
### Development Mode
To start the server in development mode, run the following command:
```bash
pnpm dev
```
### Production Mode
To start the server in production, use:
```bash
pnpm start
```
By default, the server will run on port `4000`.

## Additional Notes
* If you ever need to "reset" the database or clear migrations, you can run:
```bash
pnpm prisma migrate reset
```
